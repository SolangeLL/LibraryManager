## Why This Project Exists
During a seminar on clean architecture, I realised the importance and the benefits of well-structured code. This project was created to practice and implement these principles in a test application.


## Rules Followed
- **Layers Separation**: The project is divided into distinct layers (e.g., domain, repositories, interfaces, services) to ensure clear separation of needs.
- **SOLID Principles**: Each class and module has a single responsibility, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
